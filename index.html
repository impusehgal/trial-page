            <p> What is Tarot? Simply defined, Tarot cards are decks of cards with pictures, symbols, and numbers
                printed on them. In theory, Tarot cards are used for divination and can give insight into your past,
                present, and future.To many, Tarot reading may seem supernatural and intimidating to approach. However,
                Tarot cards can be quite simple and offer a different perspective to a difficult situation or question
                you may have. Additionally, reading Tarot cards can be simply a fun hobby.</p>
